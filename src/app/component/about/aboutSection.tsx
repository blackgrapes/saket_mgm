          Under the aegis of Saket Shikshan Samiti, which has been successfully
          managing Saket Shishu Ranjan School Vidisha since 1984, a new project
          was initiated in the form of Saket MGM Sr. Sec. School in 2009.
          Saket MGM Sr. Sec. School is affiliated to the Central Board of
          Secondary Education New Delhi.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This idea and inspiration to provide quality education to the people
          of Vidisha came from Late Mrs. Manorama Pandey and Late Mrs. Ragini
          Pandey, to whom we dedicate this humble effort of ours. Their dream
          was to give such education that will provide all children the
          opportunity for all-round development in a most democratic and
          inclusive atmosphere so that the long-neglected ancient Indian
          culture and social values can be revived.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          We are deeply indebted to them that their vision and revolutionary
          thoughts gave us inspiration to start Saket MGM Sr. Sec. School
          Vidisha, which has now become an epitome of excellence.
